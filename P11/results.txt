Full Credit
===========

Number of cores available to my test environment (in bash use ``nproc`` command):
Primes range for my machine (between 20 and 30 second runtime without threads): 

Without threads:

real	
user	
sys	


With 2 threads:

real	
user	
sys	


With 3 threads:

real	
user	
sys	


With 4 threads:

real	
user	
sys	


With 5 threads:

real	
user	
sys	


With 6 threads:

real	
user	
sys	


With 7 threads:

real	
user	
sys	


With 8 threads:

real	
user	
sys	


With 16 threads:

real	
user	
sys	


With 32 threads:

real	
user	
sys	


With 64 threads:

real	
user	
sys	


QUESTION: After threading is added to threads.cpp, is the order of prime numbers found in primes_threads.txt the same or different than in primes.txt?  Why?




QUESTION: Does adding more threads continue to speed up the program? Do more threads ever slow down the program slightly?  Why or why not?




QUESTION: Does adding more threads increase the "system load", or is it constant regardless of the number of threads?  Why?



Bonus
=====

After "load balancing" your code as discussed in the PDF, rerun the test with the same number of threads as your test environment has cores. For example, on a 4-core machine, run your code with 4 threads and record the time below.

Number of cores: 

Load Balanced
-------------

real	
user	
sys	

NOT Load Balanced
-----------------

Copy the time for this number of cores from the Full Credit section:

real	
user	
sys	

QUESTION: What difference does a load balanced thread pool make in execution time?
